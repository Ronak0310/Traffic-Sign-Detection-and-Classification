# Traffic Sign Detection and Classification
Traffic Sign recognition in real time using YOLO-v3 and additional CNN


Main goal of this project is to detect and classify the traffic signs in real time. The project involves delvelopment of two models. First model is based on YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version-3) architecture, which is trained on German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark(GTSDB) dataset. This model gives accurate detection of traffic signs as result of coorect bounding box arround the traffic sign.

Second model is based on Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), which is developed and trained on German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark(GTSRB) dataset. This model provieds accurate classification of the detected traffic signs from the YOLOv3 model.

Both models are used in stake to make detection and classification at the same time.
