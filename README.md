# Traffic Sign Detection and Classification
## Traffic Sign recognition using YOLO-v3 and additional CNN


Main goal of this project is to detect and classify the traffic signs. The project involves delvelopment of two models. First model is based on **YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version-3)** architecture, which is trained on **German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark(GTSDB)** dataset. This model gives accurate detection of traffic signs as result of correct bounding box arround the traffic sign.

Second model is based on **Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)**, which is developed and trained on **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark(GTSRB)** dataset. This model provieds accurate classification of the detected traffic signs from the YOLOv3 model.

Both models are used in stake to make detection and classification at the same time.

_**Note**_ : _Here, the second model(CNN) has been trained in order to increase the classification accuracy, because in the first Model(YoloV3) training only 900 Images were available to classify among 43 classes._
